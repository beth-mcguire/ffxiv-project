                <h2>Flynn Fox</h2>
                <p>My best friend since three years of age. He has done more for me than anyone in this damned world. We
                    were outcasts and misfits. No one wanted 'those dirty Miqo'te' and we were treated no different from
                    gutter rats. We were kicked, spat on, detested, and ridiculed by the local Hyur. So, we turned to
                    thieving no longer
                    caring about morality. We'd use money to fly to the Golden Saucer gambling to our heart's desires
                    sneaking in sips of alcohol. Thancred protected us once as kids, and I don't think he remembers it,
                    but Flynn and I are eternally grateful.
                </p>
                <p>Flynn became a top ranking officer of the Twin Adder and playfully hits on me to get a reaction. I
                    can't imagine my life without him even if he can be <em>wildly</em> infuriating. We made a promise
                    as kids: we will always be a linkpearl apart. Putting all our goals and duties aside, the other's
                    needs
                    outweigh our own as living a life without the other is meaningless.</p>
                <p>I will always be here for you,
                    Flynn. Nothing in this wretched world will ever change that. Not even you chiding me for my bleak
                    baking skills. You are my best friend, my family, my inspiration and the light that keeps me on the
                    right path. Thank you. For everything.
                </p>

                <h2>Thancred Waters</h2>
                <p>What could possibly be said about the legendary Thancred Waters? He's an idiot. A flirt. A manwhore.
                    Yet, despite his flaws, I value him as much as I do Flynn. Drinking with him leads to unforgettable
                    adventures that I wish I could forget.
                    I'd do anything for this love sick puppy. Similar to my past, he also
                    wandered the streets in Limsa Lominsa as a purse snatcher, making a lucky break and was under the
                    care of a wealthy man. A luxury I'm glad I didn't have.</p>
                <p>It's difficult to define our relationship. Thancred is <em>Thancred</em>. He is perfect the
                    way he is even if he loves to send me flying into walls spewing out thick strands of
                    blood. Yet in those times, he would cradle me afterwards and wash away the blood. He trained me
                    when I
                    asked for help improving my prowess with a blde and not once did he let
                    me down. We often make
                    wagers and the loser has to buy the next rounds of drinks. Guess who wins the most wagers? Me! Guess
                    who is growing broke because he's an idiot? Thancred! You'll get there, buddy.</p>
                <p>I love you, Thancred. Truly. With my entire being. May we live our years getting drunk in random
                    taverns
                    forgetting what in the seven hells we were talking about but vividly recalling our <em>special</em>
                    nights. Sometimes I convince myself I could fall in love with you. And then I drink.</p>

                <h2>Estinien Varlineau</h2>
                <p>A dumbass I like more than I should. Estinien enchanted my heart after a couple days forced
                    into his company. Starting as a condescending asshole, he quickly grew on me once he
                    showed a playful side, even if he is obsessed with murdering anything that wrongs him.</p>
                <p>Possessed by Nidhogg after our heroic endeavors, I was worried I'd never get another chance to see
                    him, but luck proved me wrong. However, once everything was over, he left without a word.
                    <em>Twice</em>. And
                    then pretended nothing ever happened and we were good friends again. Estinien gets his own category.
                    I hate him and I love him. I need therapy.
                </p>
                <p>You saved my life, you bastard. From fleeting loneliness. From the empire.
                    I love you in ways I cannot comprehend. I know
                    you live for the thrill of the hunt, adventures and with a lone wolf nature, we wouldn't work long
                    term. Just, don't make the next time I see you be another year and a half. I will always care about
                    you. Oh, and a word of advice: when you go to open your mouth, just don't.</p>

                <h2>Alphinaud Leveilleur</h2>
                <p>This kid has literally been with me from the start of my dastardly adventures and I'd take a bullet
                    for him. Since I first met him, he has grown so much as a person becoming one of the youngest,
                    brightest strategists I've gotten the pleasure of knowing. He's gotten well acquainted with Aymeric,
                    and the Lord Commander has been so kind to allow him command of some units while closely monitoring
                    him.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't be here if not for you, my friend. Your caring nature and desire to come to a resolution
                    has saved <em>all</em> our asses on numerous occasions. When you laugh, I laugh. When you cry, I
                    cry. When you are as energized as a squirrel, so am I. Your personality is <em>addicting</em> and
                    you're gonna go far, Alphy. I will always be there for you any time you request me. You have always
                    said I was your hero, but Alphy, you are <em>MY</em> hero and I love that about you.</p>
                <p>You, Thancred, and Alisaie have made my time as a Scion unforgettable. Every game we played, thing
                    we said and adventure we embarked on will forever be etched into my memory. We all have shared
                    trauma, but also shared happiness. Our emotions are linked by threads blind to the human
                    eye. Thank you for being you.
                    Thank you for having the courage to find the words when the rest of us stood dumbfounded. Thank you
                    for continuing your knowledge to ensure we'd be safe. Thank you, truly, for being the greatest
                    person in the world. We would be naught if not for you. Thank you. Thank you. From the bottom of my
                    heart, <em>thank you</em>.

                <h2>Alisaie Leveilleur</h2>
                <p>I am obsessed with her sassy humor and enjoy when we tagteam picking on Alphinaud, provoking major
                    reactions from him. Of every Scion, Flynn excluded, Alisaie's care for me shone through her. She
                    defended me, cried for me, fought others if she felt they were lying or thinking little of me. She
                    is my protector in a different way. She makes me feel loved, important, and always brings me out of
                    a funk simply by talking. She felt Thancred sucked training me and proved to be a better mentor. She
                    had me train four hours a day until I could disarm her. I gained muscle too, ha!</p>
                <p>Alisaie is my confidant through and through. She knew about Estinien and Thancred, offering bits of
                    advice and not once did she judge me. At least not visibly. Never wanting to be apart, she threw out
                    the idea all the Scions go in for a large house, and we did at that! We even set up an Aetheryte and
                    keep our linkpearls embedded at all times. If not for her, the Scions wouldn't be as close as they
                    are. She was usually the voice of reason and held the most passion. I'm indebted to her.
                </p>
                <p>Alisaie, you are my best lady friend and that will <em>literally</em> never change. Your personality
                    is intoxicating. Your love for me has shown through every time we're together. There were times on
                    various brinks of death, I recalled moments of you, making a sliver of hope shine through the
                    darkness. You are on par with Thancred and Flynn. May we never part again and if we do, may we
                    return back home, happy and in one piece. I love you, my sister from another mister.</p>

        <h3>About Z'valiyah Iskani</h3>
        <p>Born into poverty with no parents, I had to learn everything either from observations or on my own. Having a
            valid bias towards the Hyur, I kept my distance and stayed close to Flynn. Thancred beat up some Hyurs
            throwing rocks at us when we were little on multiple occasions. We called him our hero in shadows. I had to
            have been 10 making him 14. I caught his name, but that
            was it. Later when I formally met him, I thanked him but he claimed to have saved many Miqo'te, not
            specifically recalling me. It wasn't until a few years later he said he lied and I was the only Miqo'te he
            went out of his way to protect. Claiming my <em>beauty</em> captivated him. Idiot. Creepy, too. Childhood
            was rough, having to pickpocket thieves or take on degrading jobs to afford an inn room.</p>
        <p>Wanting to make up for wronging others, I embraced the Warrior of Light title, saving people rather than
            harming them. I got well acquainted with the Scions and volunteered to help them with their endeavors.
            Nearly losing my life countless times was exhilarating. Being a white mage, it was up to me to keep everyone
            alive and nearly failed a couple times, but thankfully the gods favored my team. I will do what I can to
            keep them and the world from falling into chaos and destruction. Our home is a place of love and beauty and
            I will stop at nothing to put an end to those threatening to take it.</p>
        <p>I suffer from a couple insecurities. I used to get ripped on for my atrocious food poisoning levels of baking
            and
            worked effortlessly to perfect my skill when I fell hopelessly in love with Thancred. It still feels like a
            horrible nightmare because it's Thancred, but I can't help it. He compliments me in every way imaginable.
            Flynn looks forward to his birthdays now, knowing he'll get something edible as do the other Scions. Can the
            world just fuck off with all their problems and allow me one year of normalcy? It's never that easy. This
            time, I'll be prepared for anything and hopefully continue to save the lives of those I hold dear to me.
            Flynn, Alphinaud, Alisaie, Thancred, Estinien, Aymeric, Tataru, Krille, Y'shtola and Urianger. May we all do
            our best and put a permanent end to war and suffering. Together, we can accomplish anything. May we continue
            to fight with the strength of every Scion. For those we have lost. For those we can yet save.</p>

        <h2>Warrior of Light Testimonies</h2>

        <p><strong>Thancred</strong>: Valiyah has saved us more times than I care to count. No words could ever express
            the gratitude I have for you. I will continue to raise my glass to being the fuck alive and to your name.
            May we thwart whatever the damned hells throw in our direction. Now, you remember where my quarters lay,
            don't you? You only need to call my name and I'll keep the bed warm for you, my elusive temptress. Ah,
            before I forget, what is so <em>terrible</em> about falling for me?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Alisaie</strong>: Completely ignoring Thancred's request to bed you - though Elusive Temptress is a
            better term of endearment than Subpar Mage - know how grateful we are for your existence. I do
            hope I have been able to quell your traumas, even a little. I will always be vocal when people speak ill of
            you and I'm proud to have made your list. I'll continue to train you, if you ask of me. Thank you for always
            having my back. Thank you for having <em>all</em> our backs. I look forward to creating more mischief
            together. Also, that alcohol you urged me try? I feel it is an acquired taste as I did not care for it. I
            love you, my dearest friend.</p>
        <p><strong>Alphinaud</strong>: Z'val, your words moved me to tears. You hold me on a pedastal I feel I don't
            deserve to be on, not even in the slightest. 'Twas courtesy of your kindness that helped to shape me into
            the person I am today. I must confess that, like my sister, I consider you to be my dearest friend and
            platonically love you in ways words cannot convey. 'Tis not only I who has grown, but you as well. If only
            you could see how incredible you are and believe the words we tell you. If I must remind you to take a
            break again, however, we will need to have an exchange of words.</p>
        <p><strong>Estinien</strong>: The Miqo'te that got away. Had I any interest in nonsensical drinking, incessant
            chatter, dancing, or complacency, I am certain you'd have stayed at my side, but alas, you were never mine
            to begin with. My lance is yours whenever you require it, Warrior of Light. You owe me naught and I am
            forever
            indebted to you. Must you find yourself longing to speak to me, I only request that you leave that irksome
            Hyur elsewhere. Farewell, Z'valiyah.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Flynn</strong>: My, my. Estinien makes it sound as though one of you are bound to die. None of these
            darlings
            harbor even an onze of my love and care for you. I would traverse the world to ensure your safety. I would
            take on several armies so you know you aren't alone in battle. I would write hundreds of ballads so you
            would have music to soothe your soul every night. There is <em>nothing</em> I wouldn't do for you, my love.
            Also, that new chocobo? I named her Iskani as a homage to you. I am glad you finally found love, but pray do
            not forget about me. Remember, darling, I am only a linkpearl away. Also, Alisaie, good call on the house. I
            frequent there often and have more appreciation for our world encroached in darkness.</p>
